# Asthriona's Home

This is my home page, I was getting tired of the default Google new tab one, so I made my own, cuz I like making my own things you know?  
There is still a lot of work to be done, as this is super basic, and most of the code is just awful to watch, but I'll be working on it. You can use it, no setup required, (except changing the links, but this will be update soon, with the possibility to delete the default one, and add your own).  
I'll be adding more features, and making it look better, but for now, this is what I have.
Oh, and the google search is not working.  

## Deployment: 
You can use my version by setting your home page to [home.asthriona.com](https://home.asthriona.com), or deploy that one, I'm personally using Cloudflare to deploy this.  
No back-end is required, everything runs in the browser, so no server costs if you want to use Vercel or whatever you like. :)  
  
## Want to help?
You can help by making a pull request, or by opening an issue, I'll be happy to help you, and I'll be happy to review your contributions!
  
## Warning:
Also, please note that since there is no Database, or no back-end, the links and username are saved in your browser, so when you clear your data it will be gone.
